## What is it?

This is a program that I wrote to make my life easier when adding AD users to the server of a client that my company services. EHTP HR used to send an Excel sheet of the new users and details on how to create them, in turn having me manually open the files and do a batch of 20+ users by hand. In order to remedy this I made it easier for them by making a Google Docs questionaire sheet that linked in to a spreadsheet which this program would connect to and make users on the server. 
## Cool! How do I use it?

### Requirements

You'll need:

* [The Eclipse IDE](http://eclipse.org/)
* [WPILibJ for Eclipse:](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/java/eclipse/update/) Add this as a software source and then install the FRC packages.
* Git

### How-to

1. Open your favorite shell (this works on Windows too) and do:
```
git clone git@github.com:mach-kernel/334-2013.git
```
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Fix your build path (this is most likely broken if your eclipse directory is not C:\eclipse\ or if you're not using Windows).
4. Set your team number within the FRC preferences
5. ???
6. Profit!
